**I only work remotely.**

I have 2+ years of iOS development experience that I gained both on commercial and open-source projects. 
I put a lot of my work on GitHub: https://github.com/Anastasia-Petrova
Although UIKit is my main development tool, I am an early adopter of SwiftUI and Combine and have gained commercial experience with these technologies on my last few projects. I am happy to share my experience with future teammates. I spend a lot of time learning: I am invested in¬†functional reactive programming,¬†unit testing, and¬†application architectures. 
I am looking to join a team of experienced engineers.
